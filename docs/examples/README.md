# Examples

The following examples are ordered to provide a ground-up understanding of MagnetoPy, starting with how data files are read and parsed, and ending with how to work with magnetometry datasets and perform analyses on them. Descriptions of the data files used in these examples can be found [here](file_descriptions) and the files themselves are found in the tests/data directory of MagnetoPy.

Data:

- [Reading a .dat file](reading_dat_file)
- [Raw Data and the .rw.dat File](rwdat_file)

Experiments:

- [The `MvsH` Experiment Class](mvsh)
- [Datasets in MagnetoPy: The `Magnetometry` Class](zfcfc)

Datasets:

- [The MagnetoPy Dataset Class: `Magnetometry`](magnetometry)

Analyses:

- [A Simple M vs. H Analysis](mvsh_analysis)
