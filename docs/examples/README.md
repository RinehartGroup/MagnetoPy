# Examples

The following examples are ordered to provide a ground-up understanding of MagnetoPy, starting with how data files are read and parsed, and ending with how to work with magnetometry datasets and perform analyses on them.

Data:

- [Reading a .dat file](reading_dat_file)
- [Raw Data and the .rw.dat File](rwdat_file)

Experiments:

- [The `MvsH` Experiment Class](mvsh)
- The `ZFC` and `FC` Experiment Classes

Datasets:

- The MagnetoPy Dataset Class: `Magnetometry`

Analyses:

- A Simple M vs. H Analysis
